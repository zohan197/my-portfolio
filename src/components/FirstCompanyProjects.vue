      Web Development Contributions at ASKI Group of Companies
    </h3>
    <p class="text-center text-gray-600 dark:text-gray-300 max-w-3xl mx-auto mb-6">
      At ASKI, I built multiple responsive, database-driven websites across the company's core and sub-brands. While designs were typically provided as PDF mockups, I converted each into fully functional and mobile-ready platforms using ASP.NET Web Forms, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap, JavaScript, and jQuery AJAX.
    </p>

      <div v-for="project in projects" :key="project.title" class="bg-white dark:bg-gray-800 p-6 rounded-2xl shadow-md hover:shadow-xl transition duration-300">

          <a :href="project.link" target="_blank" class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-blue-400 hover:underline">
            {{ project.title }}

        </h4>
        <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">{{ project.description }}</p>
        <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 italic">Responsive and backed by live database integration.</p>

          <h4 class="text-lg font-bold text-gray-800 dark:text-white mb-1">Highlight Project â€“ ACASH (E-Wallet Platform)</h4>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300">
            ACASH was a full-featured electronic wallet system with separate desktop and mobile web interfaces. I was responsible for the full architecture and implementation, including the frontend, backend, and API layer used by its mobile counterpart.
          </p>
          <p class="text-sm text-gray-700 dark:text-gray-300 mt-2">
            A major milestone was the integration of <strong class="text-indigo-600 dark:text-blue-400">ECPay</strong>, allowing seamless transactions through third-party physical outlets like 7-Eleven. I handled both API consumption and creation for ECPay integration.
          </p>
          <p class="text-xs text-gray-500 dark:text-gray-400 mt-2 italic">
            While the main website is no longer active, the app version remains available on the Play Store.
